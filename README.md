# freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python course

On the course, I gained a good foundational knowledge of data analysis with Python that covered the following modules:

1. Data Analysis with Python learning included:

   - Using Jupyter Notebooks/Google Colab
   - Reading/parsing data from multiple sources (CSV, SQL, Excel)
   - Data Cleaning - dataFrames, duplicates
   - Processing data using NumPy and Pandas
   - Visualising data using Matplotlib
   - Python basics - functions, collections, iteration and modules

2. Basics of Numpy learning included:
   - Indexing
   - Initialising Arrays
   - Reshaping
   - Applied statistics

My learning was then applied to develop the following projects:

1. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
2. Demographic Data Analyser
3. Medical Data Visualiser
4. Page View Time Series Visualiser
5. Sea Level Predictor
